2D Maze Solver

##Description
This project is a java-based program which finds the fastest path through a maze without using recursion.
The app is designed to help visualize maze-solving algorithms and optimize pathfinding processes.


##Key Features
- Visualization of fastest path
- Efficient maze-solving algorithm

##Usage
1. Create a 2D maze in the format of StarterMaze.txt with W being a wall and P being a path.
   Make Sure to include the start and end points.
2. Run the MazeRunner Class. This will prompt you in the console with which file the maze is in.
  It will print the fastest solution to the maze in the file of your choice.
